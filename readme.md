## Note: this is the `0.9.10-beta` branch!

Welcome to the OmniBox repository! OmniBox is a modular, 3D printed electronics case for controlling 3D printers. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's **[Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3999751)** V3.

This project focuses on modularity, accessibility to users, and reusability. The goal of OmniBox is to make your printer's electronics as valuable and re-usable an asset as the printer it controls.
