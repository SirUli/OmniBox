The front of the Main Body has eight (8) inserts, with four (4) canted at an angle for the display. These canted inserts are unique for the case, so we'll use the front as an example on how to install inserts.

These instructions are for the standard HSI Front Main Body (not the Full HSI version).

!!! note
    The display screen is at a **50 degree** angle, not 45. The [:material-git: practice block][git_hsi_practice] has six holes at this angle for practice purposes.

    It is important that the inserts are flush with the display surface.
