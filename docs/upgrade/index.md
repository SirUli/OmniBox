A finished OmniBox is an investment that can grow with your needs. The Core case is designed for flexibility and reuse, and every effort is made to avoid incompatibilities between versions.

### Templates

Trays and panels are based on templates that are occasionally modified between releases. If the modifications break compatibility, existing parts are generally updated to the new template.

For example, OmniBox v0.9.9 introduced v2 of the CPU tray template. Trays based on v1 are considered deprecated but still fit and work with OmniBox v0.9.10.

A future release will introduce v3, which is *not* backwards compatible. At that time, new CPU trays will be issued to replace v1 and v2 versions.

The following shows how trays and Core cases how support works for deprecated panels and traysâ€”a checkmark indicates the part is supported.

| CPU Tray Version | 0.9.8              | 0.9.9 - 0.9.10     | 0.9.11+              |
|------------------|:------------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
| **v1**           | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x:                  |
| **v2**           | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x:                  |
| **v3**           | :x:                | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |

See the [Guided Tour][tour] to see how the components of an OmniBox fit together in practice, or the [Templates][templates] page for details on each template.

### Version 1.0

Version 1.0 is a final chance to freeze design elements. After version 1.0, OmniBox releases will come with a **Version Stability Guarantee**:

> If you choose to print a newer version of a Core part, no panels or trays will need to be reprinted. New products added in  future releases can likewise be used in the Core case body from a prior release.


## Core Compatibility

### Legacy Versions (v0.9.8.1 and Earlier)

Releases prior to v0.9.9 cannot be partially upgraded.

### v0.9.9 to v0.9.10

The Main Body and Base between version v0.9.9 and v0.9.10 are compatible. Typically, a user will only reprint the Main Body to upgrade from v0.9.9 to v0.9.10 unless specific new features from the Base are needed.

The front and rear halves must be upgraded together for both the Base and Main Body.

## Tray and Panel Compatibility
